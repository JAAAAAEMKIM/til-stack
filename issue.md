# UX Issues

## Critical

- [ ] **No auto-save** - Lose work if browser crashes or accidental navigation
- [ ] **No search** - Can't find "that thing I wrote about X" - will hurt as entries grow
- [ ] **No unsaved changes warning** - Navigate away = lost work

## Medium

- [ ] **No keyboard shortcuts** - Cmd+S to save, Esc to cancel - expected in any editor
- [ ] **Calendar doesn't show skipped days** - Configured Sat/Sun to skip but calendar doesn't gray them out
- [ ] **Date shows as `2024-01-06`** - `Mon, Jan 6` is more human-friendly
- [ ] **Monthly page is repetitive** - Same entries shown 3 times (calendar dots, monthly list, weekly accordion)

## Minor

- [ ] **No dark mode toggle** - Classes exist but no way to switch
- [ ] **"Stack" terminology** - Non-devs might not get it - "Recent Entries" clearer
- [ ] **Notifications placeholder** - Why show "Coming soon"? Just hide it
